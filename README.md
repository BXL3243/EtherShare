# EtherShare

EtherShare is a contract to share information with permanent storage and open access.

The website is not the only one entry to EtherShare. EtherShare is a DApp. So you can download the html files (with the web3.js in jsdelivr cdn) to your own server or access the contract in other ways.

The contract addresses are 0xc86bdf9661c62646194ef29b1b8f5fe226e8c97e, 0x475de1f3e1ba5aeefc9fc694852c8fce59b353a1,  0x28daa51dc3d80a951af9c451d174f0c7156c6876, 0x43820f75f021c34ce13ded1595633ed39b79ab47, 0x71de0d9fea931b42297d94cac5ec915410e1da99.
